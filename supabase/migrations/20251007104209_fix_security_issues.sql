  # Fix Security Issues

  ## Overview
  This migration addresses multiple security and performance issues:
  
  1. **RLS Performance Issues**
     - Replace `auth.uid()` with `(select auth.uid())` in all policies to prevent re-evaluation per row
     - Applies to user_profiles table policies
  
  2. **Unused Indexes**
     - Remove unused indexes that add overhead without benefit:
       - idx_blog_posts_published, idx_blog_posts_tags, idx_blog_posts_slug
       - idx_user_profiles_phone, idx_user_profiles_role, idx_user_profiles_email
  
  3. **Multiple Permissive Policies**
     - Consolidate overlapping policies to avoid conflicts
     - Simplify blog_posts SELECT policies (authenticated users already get full access)
     - Keep user_profiles policies separate as they serve different purposes
  
  4. **Function Search Path**
     - Set explicit search_path on functions to prevent injection attacks
  
  ## Security
  - All changes maintain or improve existing security posture
  - RLS remains enabled and enforced
  - Access patterns remain the same but with better performance

-- Step 1: Drop and recreate user_profiles policies with optimized auth checks
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can read own profile" ON user_profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update own profile" ON user_profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert own profile" ON user_profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can manage all profiles" ON user_profiles;

CREATE POLICY "Users can read own profile"
  ON user_profiles
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING ((select auth.uid()) = id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update own profile"
  ON user_profiles
  FOR UPDATE
  TO authenticated
  USING ((select auth.uid()) = id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own profile"
  ON user_profiles
  FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK ((select auth.uid()) = id);

CREATE POLICY "Admins can manage all profiles"
  ON user_profiles
  FOR ALL
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1
      FROM user_profiles
      WHERE id = (select auth.uid()) AND role = 'admin'
    )
  );

-- Step 2: Consolidate blog_posts policies
-- Remove the redundant authenticated policy since it allows ALL with true (overly permissive)
-- Keep public read for published posts and use separate policies for authenticated write access
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated users to manage blog posts" ON blog_posts;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow public read access to published blog posts" ON blog_posts;

CREATE POLICY "Public can read published blog posts"
  ON blog_posts
  FOR SELECT
  TO public
  USING (published = true);

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can insert blog posts"
  ON blog_posts
  FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can update blog posts"
  ON blog_posts
  FOR UPDATE
  TO authenticated
  USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can delete blog posts"
  ON blog_posts
  FOR DELETE
  TO authenticated
  USING (true);

-- Step 3: Remove unused indexes
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_blog_posts_published;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_blog_posts_tags;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_blog_posts_slug;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_user_profiles_phone;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_user_profiles_role;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_user_profiles_email;

-- Step 4: Fix function search paths
ALTER FUNCTION update_blog_posts_updated_at() SET search_path = public, pg_temp;
ALTER FUNCTION update_user_profiles_updated_at() SET search_path = public, pg_temp;
ALTER FUNCTION update_updated_at_column() SET search_path = public, pg_temp;
